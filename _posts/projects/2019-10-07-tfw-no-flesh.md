<p> Originally made for the Ludum Dare 45<br>
The theme was "start with nothing"<br>
<br>
On Halloween night play as a skeleton whose on a quest to become human. Scare Trick r Treaters and take their candy while avoiding their parents.<br>
<br>
This is the first game jam I've ever taken part in and it was a great learning experience for me.<br>
<br>
Biggest mistakes I made: <br>
- created a voxel model of the skeleton that I intended to animate. Never did and replaced it with 2D art instead.<br>
- wrote and later spent hours troubleshooting a script for spawning the kids. I should have had spawnpoint objects instead.<br>
<br>
Otherwise I think it came out great. I think it feels satisfying to scare kids and take their candy and I will probably continue this project.<br>
