<p>CakeBoard is a Status Board application written in GML (GameMaker Language)<br>
<br>
At one point it time it was used by a department of 7.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
✔ Credential system uses the OS username to sign the user into their correct account. No passwords required! (If the Windows %username% isn't tied to any account on the board, the user is signed into a Guest account with no permissions)<br>
<br>
✔ A function to select someone random from the board. We used it to draw straws for 'undesirable' tasks.<br>
<br>
✔ Multiple themes!<br>
