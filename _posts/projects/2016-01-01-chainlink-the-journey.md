<p> A game made for a small community online to remember 2018 <br>
<br>
Play as the CEO of Smartcontract.com, Sergey Nazarov, and avoid an array of obstacles on your quest to have blockchains, oracles and smart contracts adopted by the world. <br>
<br>
So far this is the the game I am the most proud of. It is simple yet is the culmination of a lot of learning I have done in the past year <br>
<br>
I worked with a friend of mine who spun up the truck and pepe asset and I got the chill beat from wombocombo <br>
<br>
Playable on itch.io
